    <h2>To My Sayang ðŸ¥° </h2>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;Thank you for accepting me into your life. I could not thank you enough for doing so. I wanted to say that I love you so much for being my person, my best friend and most importantly, for being my girlfriend. I can't thank you enough for that. I am not a person who is good with words, but believe me, I do love you sincerely and deeply. What I love the most about you is you being yourself, the vibe that you radiate around me when we are on a date, I swear to god it makes me the happiest man alive at the moment!! Do you know that your smile brings me happiness? Your eyes tell so much story, I can see it brimming with love when we met eye to eye. I'm glad that we met, meeting you was nothing short of a story that is full of love, adventures and growth. We see each other grow into the person we are right now. I still remember you being mad at me for pranking you about forgetting to bring our promise ring. We did so much that day. I put a ring on you, on that day onwards, my end goal is to make you forever mine. We also did the trend you wanted, remember? The painting hahaha, it was so fun spending time with you, every ringgit that I spent can't be compared to the smile, the happiness that you bring into the relationship. Your presence is what makes me strong, you are my anchor, you pulled me out of my depression, and I appreciate that.
    </p>
    <p>
    So on this day, I want to dedicate a bouquet flowers to you, to be specific, a carnation flower ðŸ’–<br/>
    This flower symbolises the love and my admiration towards you. I hope you can accept the gift I prepared for you.

    <p>
    I know lately we haven't been on good terms, especially this year. We've been in a rough patch since, I'm sorry for what I've done sayang. I meant it, I'm learning from it, I want to change to be a better person for you, not others. I want to be the one who holds your hand till the end of my life, to lie beside you <br />
    I'm really sorry for my action, what I did is wrong, I shouldn't have done that, all you wanted was my attention and love...<br/>
    Would you forgive me sayang? Can we start back together? Can we work it out? I will treat you miles better this time. I won't repeat the same mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;Though if we couldn't, I love you till death do us part. I wish you the best of life, enjoy your time with your family, friends, and your partner. Meeting you is the best thing happened to my life, you are my favourite chapter, the one I always go back to every time. I appreciate you, really...dearly dear sweetheart.<br/> Forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely yours,<br />
